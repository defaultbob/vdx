# Requirements for vdx

Requirements for the current Vault Developer eXperience (vdx) CLI tool:

* **Authentication & Session Management:** The system must authenticate users via Username, Password, and Vault DNS, storing the session locally. It must automatically intercept INVALID\_SESSION\_ID errors and renew expired sessions during API calls.  
* **Pull Configurations:** The system must query Vault for components exclusively belonging to the metadata class. It must download their MDL definitions and store them locally in a components/\<component\_type\>/\<component\_name\>.mdl directory structure, while removing local files that no longer exist in Vault.  
* **Push Configurations:** The system must detect locally modified files by comparing current MD5 checksums against a saved state. It must push new or updated MDL definitions via the /api/mdl/execute endpoint and execute DROP commands for any components that were deleted locally.  
* **VPK Packaging & Validation:** The system must be able to bundle modified components into a ZIP-compressed Vault Package (VPK) using an XML manifest template. It must upload the package to the /services/package endpoint, poll for job completion, and automatically trigger a validation action on the resulting package.  
* **State & Ignore Tracking:** The system must maintain a local .vdx\_state.json file to track MD5 checksums of deployed files. It must bypass components matching wildcard patterns defined in a .vdxignore file.
