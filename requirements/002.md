**Include all Configuration Enhancement Requirements (Scope Expansion)**

To expand the tool to support Java SDK code, Custom Page Client Code Distributions, and Bulk Translations, the following requirements must be added or modified:

**1\. General Updates**

* **API Version Bump:** Upgrade the global Vault API version from v25.3 to v26.1 to ensure compatibility with the requested endpoints.  
* **Directory Structure Expansion:** Expand the local project structure to isolate different asset types (e.g., creating top-level directories for /javasdk, /custom\_pages, and /translations alongside the existing /components).

**2\. Java SDK Management**

* **Pull Java Code:** Implement logic to query and download Vault Java SDK files (such as .java source code files or JAR/ZIP bundles) to the local /javasdk directory.  
* **Push Java Code:** Implement logic to upload and deploy locally modified Java SDK files using the Vault Java SDK endpoints, handling any necessary ZIP bundling or specific multi-part payload formatting required by Vault.

**3\. Custom Page (Client Code) Distribution**

* **Pull Client Code:** Implement a process to retrieve all Client Code Distribution metadata from Vault and download the associated web assets (HTML, JS, CSS, images) into the /custom\_pages directory.  
* **Push Client Code:** Add logic to detect modifications in the /custom\_pages directory and upload/deploy these assets back to Vault to update the Custom Page distributions.

**4\. Bulk Translation Management**

* **Pull Translations:** Implement logic to trigger the Export Bulk Translation File job. The tool must poll the job status and download the resulting translation archives (e.g., ZIP or CSV files) into the /translations directory.  
* **Push Translations:** Allow users to deploy updated translation strings by uploading modified translation files using the Import Bulk Translation API endpoint.

**5\. VPK Package Expansion**

* **Manifest Updates:** Modify the vdx package command to dynamically include modified Java SDK files, Custom Page distributions, and Translation files in the vaultpackage.xml manifest and the generated VPK ZIP archive, ensuring Vault correctly identifies and validates the diverse configurations.
